This is a simple introduction to multi-file latex difference with github support
We will be using my other public github repo --> Magical_Fish_Tutorial as the example

Contents:
- Current
- Diff
- Old
- githubcloning.sh
- Latex_Diff_Batch.bat

The way this works, is that it clones the a newer version from a git repo to the current directory, then clones an older version to OLD. This is done using the githubcloning shell script

Then we use the batch file in the command window to take the latex difference to be output into the difference folder.
